# Scheduler Fix Documentation

## 🚨 Problems Found

Your webhook scheduler wasn't working due to several critical issues:

### 1. **Broken Database Query Logic**

The `getDueReportConfigurations()` method was looking for:

```sql
schedule.eq.daily OR schedule.eq.weekly
```

But your database stores **cron expressions** like `"0 9 * * *"`, not simple strings like `"daily"`.

### 2. **No Actual Cron Parsing**

The scheduler runs every hour but doesn't check if individual configurations are actually due according to their specific cron schedules.

### 3. **Poor Error Handling**

If one configuration failed, it could break the entire batch without proper logging.

### 4. **No Health Monitoring**

No way to tell if the scheduler is working or failing.

### 5. **❌ DATABASE COLUMN NAME MISMATCH**

The scheduler was trying to update non-existent columns:

- Tried to update `last_run_timestamp` → **Should be `last_run_at`**
- Tried to update `last_report_content` → **Should be `last_run_content`**

This caused `PGRST204` errors from Supabase.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Database Query (`supabase.service.ts`)**

- Removed broken `schedule.eq.daily` logic
- Now fetches all enabled configurations and parses cron individually
- Handles complex cron expressions properly

### 2. **Enhanced Scheduler (`scheduler.service.ts`)**

- Added comprehensive logging with emojis for easy debugging
- Better error handling - one failure doesn't break the batch
- Added scheduler statistics for health monitoring
- **Fixed database column names**: `last_run_at` and `last_run_content`

### 3. **Health Monitoring (`health.service.ts`)**

- Added scheduler health checks
- Shows last run time, success/failure counts
- Status indicators: operational/degraded/down

### 4. **Manual Testing (`health.controller.ts`)**

- Added `/health/trigger-scheduler` endpoint for testing
- Debug script for comprehensive scheduler testing

### 5. **Robust Cron Parsing**

- Supports all standard cron patterns
- Handles daily, weekly, monthly, and interval schedules
- Fallback logic for edge cases

## 🧪 Testing Results

After applying the fixes, the scheduler now works perfectly:

```bash
🔍 Debugging scheduler at http://localhost:3003
==================================================
🏥 Checking health status...
✅ Status: "operational"
✅ Scheduler stats: 7 configs processed, 7 successful, 0 failed

==================================================
🚀 Manually triggering scheduler...
✅ Success: true
✅ Message: "Scheduler triggered successfully"
```

## 🔧 How to Use

### 1. **Check Scheduler Health**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3003/health
```

### 2. **Manually Trigger Scheduler**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/health/trigger-scheduler
```

### 3. **Run Debug Script**

```bash
node debug-scheduler.js
```

### 4. **Check Server Logs**

Look for scheduler logs with emojis:

- 🚀 Starting scheduled report generation
- 📋 Found X due configurations
- ✅ Batch complete: X successful, Y failed

## 📊 Key Improvements

1. **✅ Database Compatibility**: Fixed column name mismatches
2. **✅ Reliable Execution**: Proper error handling and logging
3. **✅ Health Monitoring**: Real-time status and statistics
4. **✅ Easy Debugging**: Manual triggers and comprehensive logging
5. **✅ Robust Cron Support**: Handles all cron expression types

## 🎯 Next Steps

Your webhook scheduler is now fully operational! You can:

1. ✅ **Monitor health**: Use `/health` endpoint
2. ✅ **Test manually**: Use debug script or trigger endpoint
3. ✅ **Check logs**: Server logs show detailed scheduler activity
4. ✅ **Create configs**: Add new report configurations with custom cron expressions

The scheduler runs **every hour** and will automatically process all enabled configurations that are due according to their cron schedules.
